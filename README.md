## Introduction:
This repository is for our TMI submitting paper 'Individual Graph Representation Learning for Pediatric Tooth Segmentation from Dental CBCT'.

## Supplemental Weight:
### nnUNet-based
The training weights are for 1) Quadrant-wise Localization as well as 2) Tooth Segmentation on Quadrant-wise Data.  
The dataset used for training is a publicly available teeth dataset, containing:  
a) 76 CBCT images come from https://github.com/ErdanC/Tooth-and-alveolar-bone-segmentation-from-CBCT/  
b) 63 CBCT images come from https://ditto.ing.unimore.it/toothfairy2/  
#### 1) Quadrant-wise Localization using 3d_lowres nnUNetV2
```

```
#### 2) Tooth Segmentation on Quadrant-wise Data using 3d_fullres nnUNetV2
```

```

## More code will be uploaded soon.
